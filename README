NOTES FOR DRBD DOCUMENTATION MAINTAINERS

This is the public DRBD documentation repository. It contains the DRBD
User's Guide and may, in the future, contain other documents
describing DRBD.


BUILDING THE DOCS
=================

In order to build the documentation, you will require the following
toolchain:

 * GNU make,
 * xsltproc,
 * the docbook-xsl stylesheet collection,
 * mathmlsvg,
 * the "Computer Modern" font,
 * rsvg.

If you are working on a reasonably recent Debian or Ubuntu release,
all of the above may be installed using the following command:

apt-get install make xsltproc docbook-xsl \
  latex-xft-fonts librsvg2-bin libgtkmathview-bin 

Initiating a build run amounts to issuing "make" (or "make all") in
the top-level documentation directory. This will generate a number of
PNG and SVG graphics and HTML documents, and place them in the "html"
subdirectory.


MODIFYING AND MAINTAINING THE DOCS
==================================

In order to modify the documentation, the following additional tools
are required or highly recommended:

 * A validating XML editor such as Emacs with psgml,
 * a local copy of the DocBook XML DTD,
 * xmllint,
 * an SVG editor such as Inkscape (for modifying graphics),
 * the git version control system.

Again, here is your command if you want to install all of this on
Debian or Ubuntu:

apt-get install emacs psgml docbook-xml \
  libxml2-utils inkscape git-core


CHECKING OUT THE DOCUMENTATION SOURCES
======================================

The documentation sources live in the public DRBD git repository at
git.linbit.com. You check them out using the following git command:

git clone git://git.linbit.com/drbd-documentation

This will create a local copy of the documentation sources in a
subdirectory named "drbd-documentation" which git automatically
creates in your current working directory. Be sure to frequently
update your documentation sources with the following commands:

cd drbd-documentation
git pull

When you have made changes, please commit them in your local
checkout. Group changes that "logically" belong together in one
commit, and be sure to include an informative commit message:

git add <files you wish to include in your commit>
git commit


SUBMITTING DOCUMENTATION PATCHES
================================

If you modify the documentation, please subscribe to the drbd-dev
mailing list at http://lists.linbit.com/listinfo/drbd-dev and start
sending patches to drbd-dev@lists.linbit.com.

Please submit patches in a format that makes it easy for us to apply
them to the repository:

git pull
git format-patch origin
git send-email --to=drbd-dev@lists.linbit.com *.patch
