"'drbdmanage-proxmox' is a Perl plugin for Proxmox that, in combination with "
"DRBD Manage, allows to replicate VM disks on several Proxmox VE nodes. This "
"allows to live-migrate active VMs within a few seconds and with no downtime "
"without needing a central SAN, as the data is already replicated to multiple "
"nodes."

"The DRBD9 kernel module gets installed as a `dkms` package (i.e., `drbd-"

"install software from LINBIT's repositories. Following that order ensures "
"that the kernel module is built for your kernel. If you do not follow the "
"latest Proxmox kernel, you have to install kernel headers matching your "
"current kernel (e.g., `pve-headers-$(uname -r)`). If you did not follow that "
"advice and you need to rebuild the dkms package against your current kernel "
"(headers have to be installed), you can issue `apt install --reinstall drbd-"
