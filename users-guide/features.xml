  <title>DRBD Features</title>
  <abstract>
    <para>This chapter contains discussions of various useful DRBD
    features, and information on how to use and work with them. Some
    of these will be important to most users, some will only be
    relevant in very specific deployment scenarios.</para>

    <title>Replication protocols</title>
    <para>DRBD supports three distinct replication protocols.</para>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Protocol A</title>
      <para>Asynchronous replication protocol. Local write operations
	on the Primary node are considered completed as soon as the
	local disk write has occurred, and the replication packet has
	been placed in the local TCP send buffer. In the event of
	forced failover, data loss may occur. The data on the standby
	node are consistent after the failover, however, the most
	recent updates performed prior to the crash could be
	lost.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Protocol B</title>
      <para>Memory synchronous replication protocol. Local write
	operations on the Primary node are considered completed as
	soon as the local disk write has occurred, and the replication
	packet has reached the peer node. No writes are lost in case
	of forced failover. However, in the event of simultaneous
	power failure on both nodes and concurrent, irrevocable
	destruction of the Primary's data store, the most recent
	writes completed on the Primary may be lost.</para> 
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Protocol C</title>
      <para>Synchronous replication protocol. Local write operations
	on the Primary node are considered completed only after both
	the local and the remote disk write have been confirmed. As a
	result, loss of a single node is guaranteed not to lead to any
	data loss.</para> 
    </formalpara>
    <note>
      <para>Data loss is, of course, inevitable with every replication
	protocol if both nodes are irrevocably destroyed at the same
	time.</para>
    </note>
    <para>Note that the choice of replication protocol influences two
      factors of your deployment: <emphasis>protection</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>latency</emphasis>. <emphasis>Throughput</emphasis>,
      by contrast, is largely independent of the replication protocol
      selected.</para>
    <para>By far, the most commonly used replication protocol in DRBD
      setups is protocol C.</para>
