      <para>LINBIT, the DRBD project's sponsor company, provides DRBD
      binary packages to its commercial support customers. These
	packages are available at <ulink
	  url="http://www.linbit.com/support/"/> and are considered
      "official" DRBD builds.</para>
      <para>These builds are available for the following
      distributions:

	    <para>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 4 and 5</para>

	LINBIT releases binary builds in parallel with any new DRBD
	source release.</para>
      <para>Package installation on RPM-based systems (SLES, RHEL) is
	done by simply invoking <command>rpm&nbsp;-i</command> (for
	new installations) or <command>rpm&nbsp;-U</command> (for
	upgrades), along with the corresponding
	<filename>drbd</filename> and <filename>drbd-km</filename>
	package names. </para>
      <para>For Debian-based systems (Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu)
	systems, <filename>drbd8-utils</filename> and
	<filename>drbd8-module</filename> packages are installed with
	<command>dpkg&nbsp;-i</command>, or <command>gdebi</command>
	if available.</para>

    <section id="s-distro-packages">
      <title>Packages supplied by distribution vendors</title>
      <para>A number of distributions include DRBD, including
      pre-built binary packages. Support for these builds, if any, is
      being provided by the associated distribution vendor. Their
      release cycle may lag behind DRBD source releases.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), includes DRBD in
	    versions 9 and 10, however as of SLES 10 SP2 supports only
	    DRBD version 0.7.</para>
	  <para>On SLES, DRBD is normally installed via the software
	    installation component of YaST2.</para>

	  <para>Debian GNU/Linux includes DRBD 8 from the forthcoming
	    release <code>lenny</code> onwards, has included DRBD 0.7
	    since Debian 3.1 (<code>sarge</code>).</para>
	  <para>On <code>lenny</code> (which now includes pre-compiled
	    DRBD kernel modules and no longer requires the use of
	    <command>module-assistant</command>), you install DRBD by
	    issuing:</para>
	  <programlisting>apt-get install drbd8-utils drbd8-module</programlisting>
	  <para>On Debian 3.1 and 4.0, you must issue the following
	    commands:
	  <programlisting>apt-get install drbd0.7-utils drbd0.7-module-source build-essential module-assistant
module-assistant auto-install drbd0.7</programlisting>
	    See <xref linkend="s-build-deb"/> for details on the
	    installation process involving
	    <command>module-assistant</command>.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>CentOS has had DRBD 8 since release 5, included 0.7 in
	    release 4.</para>
	  <para>DRBD can be installed using <command>yum</command>
	    (note that you will need the <code>extras</code>
	    repository enabled for this to work):
	    <programlisting>yum install drbd kmod-drbd</programlisting></para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>Ubuntu includes DRBD 8 since release 7.10 (Gutsy
	    Gibbon), and has had DRBD 0.7 since release 6.06 (Dapper
	    Drake). To get DRBD, you need to enable the
	    <code>universe</code> component for your preferred Ubuntu
	    mirror in <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>, and
	    then issue these commands:
	  <programlisting>apt-get update
apt-get install drbd8-utils drbd8-module-source build-essential module-assistant
module-assistant auto-install drbd8</programlisting>
	  </para>
	  <warning>
	    <para>Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) and 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) both
	      contained <emphasis>pre-release</emphasis> versions of
	      DRBD 8 that were never intended to be used on a
	      production system. The DRBD 0.7 version also included in
	      these Ubuntu releases, however, is fit for production
	      use (albeit now outdated).</para>
