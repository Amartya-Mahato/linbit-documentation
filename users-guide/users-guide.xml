    <title>Getting and installing DRBD</title>
    <section>
      <title>Downloading the DRBD sources</title>
      <para>The source tarballs for both current and historic DRBD
	releases are available for download from <ulink
	  url="http://oss.linbit.com/drbd/"/>.<footnote>
	  <para>LINBIT is the company that acts as the DRBD project's
	    primary sponsor, and which also provides commercial DRBD
	    support and consultancy services. More information about
	    LINBIT is available at <ulink
	      url="http://www.linbit.com/"/>.</para>
	</footnote> Source tarballs, by convention, are named
	<filename>drbd-x.y.z.tar.gz</filename>, where
	<varname>x</varname>, <varname>y</varname> and
      <varname>z</varname> refer to the major, minor and bugfix
      release numbers.</para>
      <para>DRBD is quite lean, the compressed source archive is less
      than half a megabyte in size. To download an uncompress into
      your current working directory, issue
	the following commands:</para>
      <example>
	<title>Downloading and uncompressing the DRBD source
	tarball</title>
	<programlisting>wget http://oss.linbit.com/drbd/drbd-8.2.4.tar.gz
tar -xzf drbd-8.2.4.tar.gz</programlisting>

      <section id="s-build-prereq">
	<title>Checking build prerequisites</title>
	<para>Before being able to build DRBD from source, your build
	  host must fulfill the following prerequisites:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para><code>gcc</code>, the glibc development libraries,
	      <code>make</code>, and the <code>flex</code> scanner must
	      be installed.</para>
	    <note>
	      <para>You should make sure that the gcc you use to compile the module
		is the same which was used to build the kernel you are running.
	      </para>
	    </note>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you are running a stock kernel supplied by your
	      distribution, you should install a matching precompiled
	      kernel headers package. These are typically named
	      <code>kernel-dev</code>, <code>kernel-headers</code>,
	      <code>linux-headers</code> or similar. In this case, you
	      can skip <xref linkend="s-build-prepare-tree"/> and
	      continue with <xref
		linkend="s-build-compile-kernel-module"/>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If you are not running a distribution stock kernel
	      (i.e. your system runs on a kernel built from source
	      with a custom configuration), your kernel source files
	      must be installed. Distribution packages for kernel
	      sources are typically named
	      <code>kernel-source</code><footnote>
		<para>Note that on RPM-based systems, these packages
		  will be named similar to
		  <filename>kernel-source-VERSION.rpm</filename>,
		  which is easily confused with
		  <filename>kernel-VERSION.src.rpm</filename>. The
		  former is the correct package to install for
		  building DRBD.</para></footnote> or similar. In this
	      case, you must continue with <xref
		linkend="s-build-prepare-tree"/>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </section>
      <section id="s-build-prepare-tree">
	<title>Preparing the kernel source tree</title>
	<para>To prepare your source tree for building DRBD, you must
	first enter the directory where your unpacked kernel sources
	  are located. Typically this is
	<filename>/usr/src/linux-VERSION</filename>, or simply a
	  symbolic link named <filename>/usr/src/linux</filename>:
	  <programlisting>cd /usr/src/linux</programlisting></para>
	<para>The next step is recommended, though not strictly
	necessary. It essentially reverts your kernel source tree to
	its original state, removing any leftovers from an earlier
	build or configure run:
	<programlisting>make mrproper</programlisting></para>
	<para>Now it is time to <emphasis>clone</emphasis> your
	currently running kernel configuration into the kernel source
	tree. There are a few possible options for doing this:
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Many reasonably recent kernel builds export the
		currently-running configuration, in compressed form, via the
		<filename>/proc</filename> filesystem, enabling you to copy
		from there:
		<programlisting>zcat /proc/config.gz > .config</programlisting>
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>SUSE kernel Makefiles include a
	      <code>cloneconfig</code> target, so on those systems,
	      you can issue:
		<programlisting>make cloneconfig</programlisting></para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Some installs put a copy of the kernel config into
		<filename>/boot</filename>, which allows you to do
		this:</para>
	      <programlisting>cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config</programlisting>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Finally, you may simply use a backup copy of a
		<filename>.config</filename> file which you know to
		have been used for building the currently-running
		kernel.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section id="s-build-compile-kernel-module">
	<title>Compiling DRBD as a kernel module</title>
	<note>
	  <para>This section only applies to building DRBD as a
	    loadable module. If you want to build DRBD right
	    <emphasis>into</emphasis> your kernel image, you will have
	    to patch your kernel. See <xref
	    linkend="s-build-patch-kernel"/>. Using DRBD as a loadable
	    module is the preferred option.</para>
	</note>
	<para>After changing into your unpacked DRBD sources
	directory, you should now change into the kernel module
	  subdirectory, simply named <filename>drbd</filename>, and
	build the module there:
	  <programlisting>cd drbd
make clean all</programlisting></para>
	<para>This will build the DRBD kernel module to match your
	currently-running kernel, whose kernel source is expected to
	be accessible via the 
	  <filename>/lib/modules/`uname&nbsp;-r`/build</filename> symlink.</para>
	<para>If you are building DRBD against a kernel
	<emphasis>other</emphasis> than your currently running one,
	  set the <varname>KDIR</varname> variable explicitly:
	  <programlisting>cd drbd
make clean
make KDIR=/path/to/kernel/source</programlisting></para>
	<para>If you are building against a stock kernel (one that was
	shipped pre-compiled with your distribution), you may also set
	  the <varname>KDIR</varname> variable to point to a
	<emphasis>matching</emphasis> kernel headers (as opposed to
	kernel sources) directory, for
	example:
	  <programlisting>cd drbd
make clean
make KDIR=/usr/src/linux-include/athlon</programlisting></para>
	<para>You also have the option of setting the compiler
	  explicitly via the <varname>CC</varname> variable. This is
	known to be necessary on some Fedora versions, for example:
	  <programlisting>cd drbd
make clean
make CC=gcc32</programlisting></para>
	<para>If the module build completes successfully, you will see
	  a kernel module file named <filename>drbd.ko</filename> in
	  the <filename>drbd directory</filename>.</para>
      </section>
      <section id="s-build-patch-kernel">
	<title>Patching DRBD into the kernel</title>
	<note>
	  <para>This section only applies to building DRBD into a
	    kernel image, as opposed to compiling it as a loadable
	    module. Only use this if you have a valid reason to, for
	    example if you are building a kernel without loadable
	    modules support. Normally, using DRBD as a loadable
	    module is the preferred option.</para>
