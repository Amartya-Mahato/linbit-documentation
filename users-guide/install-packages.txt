== Installing pre-built DRBD binary packages


[[s-linbit-packages]]
=== Packages supplied by LINBIT

LINBIT, the DRBD project's sponsor company, provides DRBD binary
packages to its commercial support customers. These packages are
available via repositories (for +apt+, +yum+, etc.) and are considered
"official" DRBD builds.

These builds are available for the following distributions:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 6 and 7

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), versions 11SP3, 11SP4, and 12

* Debian GNU/Linux, 6.0 (squeeze), 7.0 (wheezy), and 8.0 (jessie)

* Ubuntu Server Edition LTS 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) and LTS 14.04 (Trusty Tahr).

Packages for some other distributions are built as well, but don't receive as much testing.

LINBIT releases binary builds in parallel with any new DRBD source
release.

Package installation on RPM-based systems (SLES, RHEL) is done by
simply invoking +yum install+ (for new installations) or +yum update+ (for
upgrades).

For Debian-based systems (Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu) systems,
+drbd-utils+ and +drbd-module+ packages are installed with +apt-get+,
or similar tools like +aptitude+ or +synaptic+, if available.


[[s-distro-packages]]
=== Packages supplied by distribution vendors

A number of distributions provide DRBD, including pre-built binary
packages. Support for these builds, if any, is being provided by the
associated distribution vendor. Their release cycle may lag behind
DRBD source releases.

==== SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

SLES High Availability Extension (HAE) includes DRBD.


On SLES, DRBD is normally installed via the software installation
component of YaST2. It comes bundled with the High Availability
package selection.

Users who prefer a command line install may simply issue:

---------------------------------------
# yast -i drbd
---------------------------------------

or

---------------------------------------
# zypper install drbd
---------------------------------------


====  Debian GNU/Linux

Debian GNU/Linux includes DRBD 8 from the 5.0 release (+lenny+)
onwards. In 6.0 (+squeeze+), which is based on a 2.6.32 Linux kernel,
Debian ships a backported version of DRBD.

Starting from +squeeze+, and since DRBD is already included with the stock
kernel, all that is needed to install is the +drbd-utils+ package:

---------------------------------------
# apt-get install drbd-utils # or drbd8-utils on older distributions
---------------------------------------

==== CentOS

CentOS has had DRBD 8 since release 5.

DRBD can be installed using +yum+ (note that you will need the
+extras+ repository enabled for this to work):

---------------------------------------
# yum install drbd kmod-drbd
---------------------------------------


==== Ubuntu Linux

To install DRBD on Ubuntu, you issue these commands:

---------------------------------------
# apt-get install drbd-utils # or drbd8-utils
---------------------------------------

On (very) old Ubuntu versions you might need to explicitly install
+drbd8-module+, too; in newer versions the default kernel already includes the
upstream DRBD version.
