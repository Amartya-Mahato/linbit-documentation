== Installing pre-built DRBD binary packages


[[s-linbit-packages]]
=== Packages supplied by LINBIT

LINBIT, the DRBD project's sponsor company, provides DRBD binary
packages to its commercial support customers. These packages are
available at http://www.linbit.com/support/ and are considered
"official" DRBD builds.

These builds are available for the following distributions:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), versions 4 and 5

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), versions 9, 10, and 11

* Debian GNU/Linux, versions 4.0 (etch) and 5.0 (lenny)

* Ubuntu Server Edition LTS, versions 6.06 (Dapper Drake) and 8.04
  (Hardy Heron).

LINBIT releases binary builds in parallel with any new DRBD source
release.

Package installation on RPM-based systems (SLES, RHEL) is done by
simply invoking +rpm -i+ (for new installations) or +rpm -U+ (for
upgrades), along with the corresponding +drbd+ and +drbd-km+ package
names.

For Debian-based systems (Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu) systems,
+drbd8-utils+ and +drbd8-module+ packages are installed with +dpkg -i,
or gdebi+ if available.


[[s-distro-packages]]
=== Packages supplied by distribution vendors

A number of distributions include DRBD, including pre-built binary
packages. Support for these builds, if any, is being provided by the
associated distribution vendor. Their release cycle may lag behind
DRBD source releases.

==== SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), includes DRBD 0.7 in versions 9
and 10. DRBD 8.2 is included in SLES 11 High Availability Extension
(HAE).

On SLES, DRBD is normally installed via the software installation
component of YaST2. It comes bundled with the High Availability
package selection.

Users who prefer a command line install may simply issue:

---------------------------------------
yast -i drbd
---------------------------------------

or

---------------------------------------
rug install drbd
---------------------------------------


====  Debian GNU/Linux

Debian GNU/Linux includes DRBD 8 from the 5.0 release (+lenny+)
onwards, and has included DRBD 0.7 since Debian 3.1 (+sarge+).

On +lenny+ (which now includes pre-compiled DRBD kernel modules and no
longer requires the use of +module-assistant+), you install DRBD by
issuing:

---------------------------------------
apt-get install drbd8-utils drbd8-module
---------------------------------------

On Debian 3.1 and 4.0, you must issue the following
commands:

---------------------------------------
apt-get install drbd0.7-utils drbd0.7-module-source \
  build-essential module-assistant
module-assistant auto-install drbd0.7
---------------------------------------

See <<s-build-deb>> for details on the installation process involving
+module-assistant+.


==== CentOS

CentOS has had DRBD 8 since release 5; DRBD 0.7 was included in
release 4.

DRBD can be installed using +yum+ (note that you will need the
+extras+ repository enabled for this to work):

---------------------------------------
yum install drbd kmod-drbd
---------------------------------------


==== Ubuntu Linux

Ubuntu includes DRBD 8 since release 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), and has had
DRBD 0.7 since release 6.06 (Dapper Drake). To get DRBD, you need to
enable the +universe+ component for your preferred Ubuntu mirror in
+/etc/apt/sources.list+, and then issue these commands:

---------------------------------------
apt-get update
apt-get install drbd8-utils drbd8-module-source \
  build-essential module-assistant
module-assistant auto-install drbd8
---------------------------------------

Ubuntu 6.10 (Edgy Eft) and 7.04 (Feisty Fawn) both contained
*pre-release* versions of DRBD 8 that were never intended to be used
on a production system. The DRBD 0.7 version also included in these
Ubuntu releases, however, is fit for production use (albeit now
outdated).
